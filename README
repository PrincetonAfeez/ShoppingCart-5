This is a sample repository that I'm using to develop talks and examples for fast rails tests.

The basic flow is in branches

Master

Rails-y (this is a more idiomatic rails version)

Move to model (this extracts the logic into the model, tests still slow)

No Rails (this pulls the logic out of a dependency on rails, so the tests can be run very quickly)
to run specs:
time rspec -I lib/shopping_cart_extensions/ spec_no_rails/
